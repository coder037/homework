============================================================

Apart from the Lawyers' view, this is how I myself understand things:
 *  My choice of the "copyright" is the full copyleft.
 *  What it means?
 *  I sincerely believe that the humanity is the whole and
 *  the information flow is to be free. If otherwise, not
 *  these people will take the power and enslave the knowledge.
 *
 *  Disregarding what I personally believe, I hereby make three statements:
 *     1) everyone's code is worth citing (i.e. I cite foreign code)
 *     2) I will certainly not offer anybody's else code as of mine
 *     3) I do not intend make money with this code
 *         (because of if otherwise, other ethics might apply)
 *
 * Disclaimer: I refuse to accept the copyright as the weapon to limit
 *  the knowledge. Provided we speak about the sole knowledge and not
 *  making money with it, I refuse to recognize anybody's right to
 *  publish the code, and then cover it by some "copyright" prohibiting
 *  the re-distribution. If so - DO NOT publish it. However, should
 *  readers earn with the help of that code, things might be different.
